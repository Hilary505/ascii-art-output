# ASCII Art Output

## Overview
ASCII Art Output  is a  program written in Go that converts input strings into their graphical representations using ASCII characters with the template  name as the second argument.
The program  is also designed to handle colors as a commandline argument but the last argument should be the name of the template.

## Features for fs 
```
* Convert any input string using ASCII characters into ASCII art.
* Add the name of the template of your choice as your second argument.
```

## Features for colors
```
* Convert any input string with ASCII characters into ASCII art.
* Customize the color of individual letters or sets of letters using the --color flag.
* Supports  only ansi color system e.g "black":  "\u001b[30m"],
```

## Installation
To use ASCII Art fs and/or ASCII Art Color with fs , you'll need Go installed on your system. You can install it via the official Go website.

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://learn.zone01kisumu.ke/git/joseowino/ascii-art
```

## Usage for fs 
Navigate to the project directory and run the program with the desired input string and template name:
```
Usage: go run . [STRING] [BANNER]
```

### Example:
```
 go run . "hello" standard | cat -e
 ```
 The progam will output the  Ascii representation of the input string  using the specified bannerfile. 

## Usage for color with fs
Navigate to the project directory and run the program with the desired  color options, input string and template name:
```
go run . [OPTIONS] "Your input string" [BANNERFILE NAME]
```
### Options
```
* --color=<color> <letters to be colored>: Specifies the color and letters to be colored in the output.
* If the letters are not specified, the whole string will be colored.
```
### Example I:
```
go run . --color=red "Hello, World!" | cat -E
```
The program will output the ASCII representation of the input string with the specified letters colored in red.

### Example II:
```
go run . --color=red "kit"  "king kit kitten kit"  shadow | cat -E
```
The program will output the ASCII representation of the input string with substring kit colored red.
